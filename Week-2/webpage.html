            <h2>Production</h2>
            <p>Filmmaking (film production) is the process by which a motion picture is produced. Filmmaking involves a number of complex and discrete stages, starting with an initial story, idea, or commission. It then continues through screenwriting, casting, pre-production, shooting, sound recording, post-production, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and an exhibition. Filmmaking occurs in a variety of economic, social, and political contexts around the world. It uses a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques.</p>

            <h2>Script</h2>
            <p>Script Coverage, a freelance job held by recent university graduates, does not feed scripts into the system that are ready for production nor already produced. "Coverage" is a way for young screenwriters to be read and their ideas might make their way up to an executive or famous producer and result in "meet and greets" where relations with up and comers can be formed. But it has not historically yielded ideas studios pursue into production.</p>

        
        
            <h2>Screenplay</h2>
            <p>
             Once a screenplay is "green-lit" directors and actors are attached and the film proceeds into the pre-production stage. Although very often the Development stage and the Pre-Production stage will overlap. Projects which fail to obtain a green light may have protracted difficulties in making the transition to pre-production and enter a phase referred to as developmental hell for extended period of time or until developmental turnaround.
